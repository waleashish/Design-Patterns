# Design-Patterns
This repo contains explanatory code and analysis of software design patterns.


## What is a design pattern

A software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code but a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

## Types of design patterns

1. **Creational Patterns**: These deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. Examples include the Singleton, Factory, and Abstract Factory patterns.

2. **Structural Patterns**: These deal with object composition or how classes and objects can be combined to form larger structures. Examples include Adapter, Composite, and Decorator patterns.

3. **Behavioral Patterns**: These deal with object interaction and responsibility. They help in defining how objects communicate with each other. Examples include Observer, Strategy, and Command patterns.

## How are we going to explore them?

In this repo, we will explore many design patterns in detail in the following format:

- **Pattern Name**: A descriptive name to identify the pattern.
- **Problem**: The problem the pattern addresses.
- **Example solution**: A detailed description of how to solve the problem, including the classes and objects involved and their roles and collaborations.
- **Consequences**: The results and trade-offs of applying the pattern, including its impact on a systemâ€™s flexibility, extensibility, or performance.
