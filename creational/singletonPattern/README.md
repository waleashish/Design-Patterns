# Singleton pattern

Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern. It is helpful when a single instance of a class is needed throughout the entire lifespan of the application and also provides a global access point to it.

Singleton classes are often used for use cases like logging, caching, driver objects, and database connection.

In our code, we have taken the database connection problem to further explain the pattern.
