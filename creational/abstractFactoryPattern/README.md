# Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a **creational design pattern**. It is used to create families of related objects. 

## Use Case: Payment Gateway

In an application that supports multiple payment gateways (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal, UPI, etc.), users select the payment type at runtime. This means the payment type is a runtime input to our system. Based on the payment type, our system needs to determine multiple objects which will be used to process the payment successfully (e.g. payment processor, payment validator). These objects are, therefore, related to each other and need to be created at runtime based on input.The Abstract Factory Pattern is ideal for this scenario.


### Problem with Direct Instantiation

Direct instantiation involves creating objects using the `new` keyword or directly within the client code. This approach has several drawbacks:

1. **Tight Coupling**: The client code becomes tightly coupled with the specific classes it instantiates. This makes it difficult to change the implementation or add new payment gateways.
   
2. **Scalability Issues**: If new payment gateways need to be added, the client code must be modified to handle the creation of new objects. This violates the Open/Closed Principle (one of the SOLID principles), which states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. **Maintenance Difficulty**: As the number of payment gateways increases, the client code becomes more complex and harder to maintain.

### Solution with Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory Pattern provides a solution by encapsulating the creation of related objects within a factory. The client code interacts with the factory to obtain instances of these objects, without knowing the specific classes being instantiated.

### Components in the Payment Gateway Example

1. **Abstract Factory**: Defines methods to create abstract products like `PaymentProcessor` and `PaymentValidator`.
2. **Concrete Factories**: Implement the methods to create specific variants of these products for each payment gateway.
3. **Abstract Products**: Interfaces for payment processors and validators.
4. **Concrete Products**: Implementations of these interfaces for each payment gateway.

### Benefits

- **Encapsulation**: Hides the creation details of the payment components.
- **Flexibility**: Allows switching between different payment methods without changing the client code.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that components created by a factory are compatible with each other.

By using the Abstract Factory Pattern, the payment processing system becomes more flexible and maintainable, allowing for easy addition of new payment methods in the future.
